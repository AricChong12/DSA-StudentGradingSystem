# DSA-StudentGradingSystem
--Project Overview--
The project is about Student Grading System, programmed just to suits the needs of teaching force. The system allows users to enter student credentials to make them available for marking purposes. A student grade can be graded or undone in the system. The system also introduces specific student searching system to know their grade and view all the marked students system.

--Descriptions of data structures and algorithms used--

1. Queue
A data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out(FIFO) method. The first element in the queue will always be the one which will get removed. It is often used in operating system to handle customer service related stuff.

2. Stack
An important yet fundamental data structure that follows Last-In, First-Out(LIFO) principle, hints that the last entered element will be the first to be out. This data structure is often used in task scheduling.

3. Linked List
This data structure is a sequence of linearly connected nodes that normally contains two fields, the data field that stores data and the link field that links to another sequenced node.

4. Sequential Search
This is a simple yet easy-implementing searching algorithm that checks each element in a particular list, one by one sequentially until it finds a match or reaches the end of the list.
